# A novel image inpainting model based on multi-scale parallel dense connection network
## Overview
MSPDCN can make full use of the feature information in the image, reduce the absolute dependence between the front and back layers in the feature extraction process, and strengthen the connection between different scales in the image to improve the inpainting effect.
## Requisites
Python 3.7+
## Dependencies
* TensorFlow
* OpenCV, PIL
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
## Model architecture
